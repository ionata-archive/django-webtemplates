        This template is named "secondary_page.html" locally, but lives at
        <a href="{{ STATIC_URL }}templates/remote_name.html">{{ STATIC_URL }}templates/remote_name.html</a>.
        This allows you to name your templates sensible things in your application,
        if you can not do so in the remote application.
